MATLAB R2014a on university computers.


--- Functionality ---

imReadAndConvert is given an image filename, and converts it from RGB to
grayscale if requested (representation 1). If there's a problem with the file,
0 is returned.

imDisplay displays a given image in a requested representation (RGB or
grayscale), with pixel info.

transformRGB2YIQ and transformYIQ2RGB convert a given image from RGB to YIQ
and from YIQ to RGB, respectively. If there's a problem with the input
image, 0 is returned.

histogramEqualize

quantizeImage

Error handling - all problems result in returning a zero value, which
signals the receiving function that an error occured and it should exit.
